<br />
  I have made a dns server for my domain, dhcp server for giving ip adresses to the generated users, and remote access to have the users connect to the server
<br />
  
IP configuration:  <br/>

<br />
  here I used a private IP for the server and then made another network for actually connecting to my internet
<br />
<br/>
so far I have practiced on my server, like reseting passwords and configuring the dns, dhcp, and network
I plan to develop this further
